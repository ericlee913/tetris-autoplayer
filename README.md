# Tetris AutoPlayer: Junwoo'sPlayer

## Overview

This project is a part of a coursework assignment where we were provided with the code for the Tetris game, and the task was to develop an autoplayer for it. I developed the class `Junwoo'sPlayer`, which serves as the automatic player for the game of Tetris.

The main objective of this coursework was to create a fully functional autoplayer that can interact with the game autonomously and make decisions to play optimally. The provided game code forms the basis of the project, with the focus being on building the autoplayer.

## Features

- **Junwoo'sPlayer**: A custom class that implements the logic for automatically playing Tetris by making optimal decisions in real-time.

## Getting Started

To run the autoplayer, simply run the game code and set `Junwoo'sPlayer` as the player for the game.

## How it Works

`JunwoosPlayer` uses decision-making algorithms and heuristics to choose the best possible placements for each Tetris piece. Its goal is to clear rows efficiently and avoid losing, ensuring that the game can continue for as long as possible.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed to run the project:

- Python 3.x
- The provided Tetris game code

## Running the Game

To run the game with `Junwoo'sPlayer` as the autoplayer:

1. Clone the repository or download the provided game code.
2. Replace the default player with `Junwoo'sPlayer`.
3. Run the game script to see the autoplayer in action.

## Coursework

This project is part of a coursework assignment, where the focus was on building an autoplayer for Tetris using the provided game framework. The goal was to create a player capable of playing the game autonomously and efficiently.
